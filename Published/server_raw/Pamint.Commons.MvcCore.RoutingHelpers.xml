            Helper method that play well with the string interpolation feature.
            It inverts the behavior of the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Routing system. 
            If it receives a string surrounded by '[' and ']' (instead of '{' and '}') it will take it as a static
            segment. In oppossition, it will take every string outside '[' and ']' as a segment variable and properly 
            surround it with '{' and '}' characters.
            It will also add a leading '/' in case it doesn't exists.
